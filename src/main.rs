//! Bevy Match-3
//!
//! A fully-playable match-3 game built with Bevy 0.18.
//!
//! # Reading guide
//!
//! If this is your first time in the codebase, read the modules in this order:
//!
//! 1. **`main.rs`:** [`ScreenState`], [`GameState`], [`GameSystems`], and the overall
//!    plugin wiring. These define the core patterns of the game.
//!    Note that [`GameState`] is a *substate* of [`ScreenState`]: it only
//!    exists while [`ScreenState::InGame`] is active, and is automatically
//!    removed when the player returns to the main menu.
//!
//! 2. [`gems`]: the [`GemType`] enum, its colours, and the visual sync
//!    systems that keep sprite transforms and colours in step with the board.
//!
//! 3. [`board`]: [`Grid`] resource (the authoritative board state),
//!    [`GridPos`] and matching logic.  Understanding [`Grid`] is a prerequisite for everything else.
//!
//! 4. [`cursor`]: singleton [`BoardCursor`] entity and sprite management.
//!
//! 5. [`input`]: keyboard, mouse, and gamepad handlers.  Each produces a
//!    [`SelectAction`] message consumed by [`selection`].
//!
//! 6. [`selection`]: turns [`SelectAction`] messages into [`SwapMessage`]s.
//!    Owns selection state and selected-gem highlighting.
//!
//! 7. [`game_logic`]: swap resolution, cascade, gravity,
//!    refill, and scoring. The heart of the game.
//!
//! 8. [`audio`]: plays one-shot sound effects in response to game events.
//!
//! 9. [`in_game_ui`]: the in-game UI. Currently just a score counter.
//!
//! 10. [`menu`]: the title screen shown in [`ScreenState::MainMenu`].
//!
//! [`ScreenState`]: self::ScreenState
//! [`GameState`]: self::GameState
//! [`GameSystems`]: self::GameSystems
//! [`GemType`]: gems::GemType
//! [`Grid`]: board::Grid
//! [`GridPos`]: board::GridPos
//! [`SelectAction`]: input::SelectAction
//! [`BoardCursor`]: cursor::BoardCursor
//! [`SwapMessage`]: selection::SwapMessage
